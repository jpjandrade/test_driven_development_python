# test_driven_development_python
This repository contains my code while following the Test-Driven Development with Python book. There is a free web version of the book available on the web [here](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com).

This repository is purely meant for (my) educational purposes and it's guaranteed to be correct or useful to anyone :-P.
